### Predefined Rules

- If the amount is **not divisible** by installments, the **First installment** values will be different from other installments.
- Base price of policy is **11%** from entered car value, except every Friday 15:00-20:: oâ€™clock (user time) when it is **13%**. More rules can be add in project config file.
- I've added **1 second delay** to response time just for better experience in ajax calls in **demo**.
